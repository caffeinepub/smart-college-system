  "summary": "The diff adds a full React landing page with required sections, feature cards, dashboard mockup previews, analytics charts, face-attendance concept demo, interactive admissions + chatbot demos, and a contact form wired to a Motoko backend method. However, some acceptance criteria are not evidenced (notably prefers-reduced-motion support and the presence of the required generated image files under public/assets/generated). The diff also introduces several backend/user-profile/access-control features not requested in the BuildRequest.",
